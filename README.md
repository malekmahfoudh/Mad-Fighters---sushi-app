## Introduction

This is an app made for a restaurant called sushi vibes. The restaurant asked for a app where you can order take-away food and wanted it to be for both customers and employees.
The project is a fullstack app built with [React](https://react.dev) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
The app is also deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) so you can try it out! It works best in mobile view since we made it mobile first but it's also adapted for a wider screen. To go to the live version, click on the logo above or the link under "About" on the right side.

## Features

Since this is an app built from two perspectives; customer and employee, the features vary. Below is a list of the different features from the different perspectives.
See images below for clarification.
